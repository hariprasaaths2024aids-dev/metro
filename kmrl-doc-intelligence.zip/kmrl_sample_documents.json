      "content": "At 14:30 hrs on 10-09-2025, Train 1205 (Aluva-Petta service) experienced a minor derailment while approaching Platform 1 at Aluva Station. The incident occurred due to excessive speed (35 kmph) while entering the station curve (recommended speed: 25 kmph). The train operator immediately applied emergency brakes. No passengers were injured. Station staff cordoned off the area and initiated passenger evacuation procedures. Maintenance team responded within 8 minutes. Track inspection revealed minor rail displacement. Service was restored after 15 minutes. Preliminary investigation suggests need for additional speed control measures at station approaches.",
